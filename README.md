# Exploring U.S. Labor and Housing Trends: ACS 2018 Insights
Objective: The primary goal of this analysis is to generate insights into the U.S. labor and housing markets by focusing on labor force participation among individuals aged 18-64. Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), I aimed to build predictive models that effectively analyze and classify labor force participation while identifying key influencing factors.

Methodology: To achieve this objective, I implemented and compared three models:
Logistic Regression Model
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
Decision Tree Model
Each model's accuracy was evaluated to determine the best-performing approach for predicting labor force participation.

Results:The models' performances were as follows:
Logistic Regression: 92.91% accuracy
Decision Tree Model: 94.48% accuracy
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): 94.57% accuracy
Based on the accuracy comparisons, the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 94.57%. This analysis highlights the power of feature selection in improving predictive performance when analyzing labor market participation.
